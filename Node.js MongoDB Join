Join Collections
MongoDB is not a relational database, but you can perform a left outer join by using the $lookup stage.

The $lookup stage lets you specify which collection you want to join with the current collection, and which fields that should match.

Consider you have a "orders" collection and a "products" collection:

orders
[
  { _id: 1, product_id: 154, status: 1 }
]
products
[
  { _id: 154, name: 'Chocolate Heaven' },
  { _id: 155, name: 'Tasty Lemons' },
  { _id: 156, name: 'Vanilla Dreams' }
]
Example
Join the matching "products" document(s) to the "orders" collection:

var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
var url = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/";

MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  if (err) throw err;
  var dbo = db.db("mydb");
  dbo.collection('orders').aggregate([
    { $lookup:
       {
         from: 'products',
         localField: 'product_id',
         foreignField: '_id',
         as: 'orderdetails'
       }
     }
    ]).toArray(function(err, res) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(JSON.stringify(res));
    db.close();
  });
});
Save the code above in a file called "demo_mongodb_join.js" and run the file:

Run "demo_mongodb_join.js"

C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_mongodb_join.js
Which will give you this result:

[
  { "_id": 1, "product_id": 154, "status": 1, "orderdetails": [
    { "_id": 154, "name": "Chocolate Heaven" } ]
  }
]
As you can see from the result above, the matching document from the products collection is included in the orders collection as an array.
