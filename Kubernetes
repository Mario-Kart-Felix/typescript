#Services, Load Balancing, and Networking
Kubernetes networking addresses four concerns:

Containers within a Pod use networking to communicate via loopback.
Cluster networking provides communication between different Pods.
The Service resource lets you expose an application running in Pods to be reachable from outside your cluster.
You can also use Services to publish services only for consumption inside your cluster.
