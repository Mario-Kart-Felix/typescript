Black circle on way point marker and lights go out on 4-wheeler.
I'm seeing a black circle that surrounds the way point marker on the screen now. It's always present when i place a way point marker.

I don't know if this was fixed with the last update but i had been seeing a gun in my inventory appearing behind the 4-wheel after i get on - not every time i ride... just sometimes. Also, the lights have been going out on the 4-wheeler after hitting a bump. If i jump off the 4-wheeler my personal light works. When i look at the 4-wheeler the lights are on but they don't project any light outwardly to the environment.
