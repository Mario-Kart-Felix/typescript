. Establishing Relationships with Lenders 
A lender invites you to become an agent to submit and/or share appraisals on their behalf by sending 
you an electronic invitation to the email address that you provided at registration. Lender agents 
cannot send an invitation to a lender to establish a relationship. 
The lender invites you with full permissions, as described in Table 2.0.1.

Permission Level Capabilities
Full Agent can submit appraisal data files and/or share appraisals and view 
findings related to appraisals they submit on behalf of the lender. The Findings 
section of Appraisal View/Edit screen includes UAD compliance results (see 
Section 4.2.4 Findings in UCDP User Guide).
A lender agent can update information about any appraisal data file on UCDP (identified by a Doc 
File ID) that was created by that lender agent (see Section 4 of UCDP General User Guide for more 
information about viewing and editing appraisal information).
