Using the FTP Adapter with Oracle Integration
Add a For-Each Action to Iterate Over Individual Records
When an individual file is staged in Oracle Integration, add a second for-each action to iterate through each record in the file.

On the right side of the canvas, click Actions Actions icon and drag and drop the For Each action after the Process_Single_File action but within the first for-each loop.
The Create Action dialog is displayed.

Enter a name for the action, For_Each_InputRow.
Provide an optional description.
In the Repeating Element field, specify the element over which to iterate.
Here, the element over which to loop is Row, which is the name you've provided for individual rows/records within a file in the previous action. Expand the Source tree to find this element. It's present under $Process_Single_File > ReadResponse > RowSet. After you've selected the element, click Move Move icon to populate the field with the element.
