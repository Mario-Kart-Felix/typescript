Learning by Examples
Our "Show Node.js" tool makes it easy to learn Node.js, it shows both the code and the result.

Example
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);
Click on the "Run example" button to see how it works.

Examples Running in the Command Line Interface
In this tutorial there will be some examples that are better explained by displaying the result in the command line interface.

When this happens, The "Show Node.js" tool will show the result in a black screen on the right:

Example
console.log('This example is different!');
console.log('The result is displayed in the Command Line Interface');
Click on the "Run example" button to see how it works.
