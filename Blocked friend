Hi there,
First of all I am not sure if this situation is expected, when userA blocks userB, userA will also get blocked by userB.

If it is true, then I just tried something like:
@userA.block_friend( @lewagon)


It actually worked and removed userB from userA's blocked list, which should not happen as described in README.

I am wondering if anybody else has the same issue or just me doing something wrong?

Any answer or clarification is appreciated, thanks
