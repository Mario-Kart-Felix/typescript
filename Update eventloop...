Being incarcerated doesn't change your rights as an owner (we've learned a bit since the Spanish Inquisition murdered tens of thousands of innocents because the priests coveted their houses and land). Of course, it can be cumbersome to collect rent, etc. while you're in jail but that's what realtors are for.
