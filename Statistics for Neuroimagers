Statistics for Neuroimagers
Overview
This module is an overview of statistics, geared toward neuroimagers. It is meant to be both a review of basic statistics and a demonstration of how to apply them to neuroimaging data; in particular, how to set up a general linear model (GLM). Several different scenarios will be covered, including factorial designs, parameteric modulation, and interactions.
