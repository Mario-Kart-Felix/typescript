Connect to an On-Premises FTP Server
To make an on-premises FTP server publicly accessible, enable the port for public internet access. After that, you can add firewall rules to restrict or limit IP address access. With limited IP access, you can add Oracle Integration IP addresses so that only Oracle Integration can connect to an FTP server.
