python >= 5.6

Installation
CT Core DB is hosted on our internal PyPi repository. It should be installed using pip:

pip install ct-core-db
Usage
Most of the functionality exposed by this library is made available through the SQLAlchemy ct_core_db.db instance or via the db Flask commands in ct-core-api.

SQLAlchemy Enhancements
ct_core_db.lib.db_utils – Various utilities for debugging and logging SQLAlchemy queries and events
ct_core_db.lib.sqla – Improved signalling session that avoids PK collisions, base model, and model mixins
ct_core_db.lib.sqla_types – Custom SQLAlchemy column data types
MySQL Diff
Use the mysql_diff.MySQLDiffCommand to produce a database migration script based on the differences between two MySQL database schemas:

from ct_core_db.lib import mysql_diff

mysql_diff_cmd = mysql_diff.MySQLDiffCommand()
diff_output = mysql_diff_cmd('jdbc_db_url_a', 'jdbc_db_url_b')
MySQL Version Manager
Use the mysql_version.MySQLVersionManager class to create, diff, and upgrade your MySQL database schemas:

from ct_core_db.lib import mysql_diff

mysql_version_manager = mysql_version.MySQLVersionManager(engine, mysql_diff_cmd)
mysql_version_manager.init_db()
mysql_version_manager.create_db()
mysql_version_manager.diff_db()  # Invokes `mysql_diff_command`
mysql_version_manager.upgrade_db()
