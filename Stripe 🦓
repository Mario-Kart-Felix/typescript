Stripe CLI reference
This reference documents every command and flag available in Stripe’s command-line interface.

The Stripe CLI helps you build, test, and manage your Stripe integration right from the terminal.

With the CLI, you can:

Create, retrieve, update, and delete API objects.
Tail API request logs in real time.
Securely test webhooks without relying on third-party tunneling software.
Follow the installation guide to set up the Stripe CLI.

FOUND AN ISSUE?
Report bugs and issues on the Stripe CLI issue tracker so we can resolve them.

stripe login [flags]
Connect the CLI to your Stripe account by logging in to persist your secret key locally.

The Stripe CLI runs commands using a global configuration or project-specific configurations. To configure the CLI globally, run:

stripe login
You'll be redirected to the Dashboard to confirm that you want to give the CLI access to your account. After confirming, a new API key will be created for the CLI.

All configurations are stored in ~/.config/stripe/config.toml but you can use the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable to override this location.

Flags
-i, --interactive
Use interactive configuration mode if you cannot open a browser and would like to manually provide an API key.

--project-name=<project>
You can create project-specific configurations with the --project-name flag, which can be used in any context. If you do not provide the --project-name flag for a command, it will default to the global configuration.

Using Stripe API keys
The Stripe CLI supports several different ways to set and use API keys:

stripe login
--api-key flag
Environment variables
Each supports a different use case. stripe login is the easiest way to get started. Running this command will prompt you to log in from your browser and persist your API key locally, rather than requiring it for each command.

--api-key is a global flag that overrides your local configuration if you need to run one-off commands with a specific API key.

You can set two environment variables, which take precedence over all other values:

STRIPE_API_KEY: the API key to use for the CLI.
STRIPE_DEVICE_NAME: the device name for the CLI, visible in the Dashboard.

Listing all configured options
Opening the configuration file with your default editor
All commands support the --project-name global flag. You can define a unique configuration for individual projects.

Flags
-e, --edit
Opens the configuration file in your default editor.

--list
Lists all configured options (including defaults).

--set <option> <value>
string
Set a value for the specified configuration option.

--unset <option>

stripe completion [--shell <platform>]
The Stripe CLI supports autocompletion for macOS and Linux to make it easier to use the right commands with the CLI with the Bash and ZSH shells.

Set up autocompletion by running stripe completion. Depending on your platform and shell, relevant instructions will be displayed.

Details around setting up autocompletion can be also found in the Terminal Autocompletion section of our configuration guide.

Shell completion scripts are not currently supported on Windows.

Flags
--shell <platform>
The shell for which autocompletion commands will be generated. By default the CLI will attempt to autodetect the platform.

Webhook commands
Listen for webhook events and forward them to your application. Trigger and resend webhook events.

stripe listen [flags]
Receive webhook events from Stripe on your local machine via a direct connection to Stripe's API. The listen command can receive events based on a specific API version, filter by type of event, or forward events to an application running on a given port.

By default, listen accepts all webhook events and displays them in your terminal.

You don't need to configure any webhook endpoints in your Dashboard to receive webhooks with the CLI.

The webhook signing secret provided will not change between restarts to the listen command.

Flags
--connect-headers <values>
A comma-separated list of custom HTTP headers to forward to any connected accounts. This is useful when testing a Connect platform.

A comma-separated list of which events to listen for. The event types documentation includes a complete list (default: [*] for all events).

-c, --forward-connect-to <url>
The URL that Connect webhook events will be forwarded to. By default, the same URL will be used for all webhook events.

-f, --forward-to <url>
The URL that webhook events will be forwarded to. Returns a webhook signing secret which you can add to your application's configuration.

-H, --headers <values>
A comma-separated list of custom HTTP headers to forward.

-l, --latest
Receive events used in the latest API version. By default, webook events received will depend on your account's default API version.

--live
Make a live request (by default, runs in test mode).

-a, --load-from-webhooks-api
Listen for all webhook events based on your existing webhook endpoints configured in the Dashboard and API.

Resources & HTTP commands
The Stripe CLI supports two ways to create, update, and list objects based on API resources: resource commands and HTTP commands.

Resource commands directly manage API resources and provide different arguments, flags, and functionality based on which API resource is used.

HTTP commands are convenient shorthand for HTTP requests to the Stripe API. These requests can operate on individual API objects or lists of objects.

Was this section helpful?YesNo

stripe {resource command} <operation> [--param=value]
Resource commands make API requests using the CLI for a given resource. The Stripe CLI has commands to interact with all types of Stripe API resources.

A complete list of available resources and examples are included in the API Reference Guide. Select Stripe CLI from the language dropdown to see a complete example for each resource.

Use the help command on any resource to see what operations you can perform. For example, run stripe charges --help to see help for the Charges resource.

Use stripe resources to see a complete list of available resources.

All commands support making live requests with the --live flag.

Arguments
<operation>
Operation to perform on API object. Each type of API resource includes a set of operations that you can perform (such as delete, list, and retrieve).

Flags
--param=value
Parameters to attach to the operation being performed.

stripe delete /v1/customers/cus_AUWSqhhbIcBNbz

  "id": "cus_AUWSqhhbIcBNbz",
  "object": "customer",
  "deleted": true
}
stripe fixtures <filepath>
Use a JSON file to issue a series of API requests. This can be useful when generating sample data, executing specific flows, or testing API behavior.

The structure of the JSON file outlines the set of requests to perform, known as fixture requests. When you specify a request's name, the CLI stores the response so you can reference the output in subsequent requests. The path property specifies the Stripe URL route for the API resource used in the request (e.g. /v1/customers).

For example, to reference the response for the request named json_path:

Accessing attributes in responses: ${name:json_path}
Accessing environment variables: ${.env:VARIABLE_NAME|<optional default value>}
Fixture queries must start with ${ and end with } and can be included in fixture requests. name is the name of the request assigned as part of the fixture (fixtures[].name) and json_path is a dot-path to the specific variable requested. For example:

Use ${cust_bender:id} to access a top-level attribute.
Use ${cust_bender:billing_details.address.country} to access nested data.
Use {cust_bender:subscriptions.data.[0].id} to access data within a list.
Use ${.env:PHONE} to access environment variables (supports .env files).
Environment variables can specify default values with the pipe character (|). For example:

${.env:EMAIL|jane@stripe.com}
${.env:CUSTOMER|cus_1234}
Arguments
<filepath>
string
Use the JSON file at the given path that includes fixture requests to run.

Fields
_meta
object
Metadata used by CLI during execution.

Show _meta properties
fixtures
object
List of requests to execute.

Further information
See additional information how the Stripe CLI operates.

Using with Docker
A Docker image allows you to run the Stripe CLI in a container.

You can set two environment variables that the CLI will use:

STRIPE_API_KEY: the API key to use for the CLI.
STRIPE_DEVICE_NAME: the device name for the CLI, visible in the Dashboard.
Since Docker containers are ephemeral, stripe-cli login cannot be used without defining a data volume. You can use the --api-key flag instead.

    --api-key sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc
Telemetry
The Stripe CLI includes a telemetry feature that collects some usage data. This feature is enabled by default.

To opt out of telemetry, set the STRIPE_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to 1 or true.
