Using the FTP Adapter with Oracle Integration
FTP Adapter Cannot Connect to FTP/SFTP Server in Oracle Cloud
When trying to connect from Oracle Integration to an FTP server running in Oracle Cloud, the connection may not work. For example, if Oracle Support Services runs the following command:

sftp -o "ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x  proxy_host:proxy_port
%h %p" FTP_username@FTP_hostname
The following error message can be displayed. This occurs because routing is not enabled from Oracle Integration to the FTP server.

Connecting to FTP_hostname...
nc: port range not valid
ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
Couldn't read packet: Connection reset by peer
Either file a service request to ensure that the proxy allows connections to the port on which the FTP server is running or use an FTP server not running in Oracle Cloud.
