Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "activemodel":
  In snapshot (Gemfile.lock):
    activemodel (12 6.1.1)

  In Gemfile:
    has_friendship was resolved to 1.1.8, which depends on
      activemodel (12 6.1, >= 6.2.0)

    rails (~> 6.1.0) was resolved to 6.1.1, which depends on
      activemodel (12 6.1.1)

Running `bundle update` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.
