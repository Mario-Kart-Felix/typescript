Install/Update R & RStudio
Before the first session
To participate in the Data Science Essentials in R series, please bring a laptop with R and RStudio installed. We recommend that you have the latest version of R (3.5.2 Eggshell Igloo) and of the tidyverse package (1.2.1). You need to have RStudio installed, but it is less crucial that you are using the most recent version (1.1.463).

Do you already have R and RStudio installed?

No - follow the instructions for “I do not have R installed”
Yes - follow the instructions for “I have R installed”
“I do not have R installed”
You should install R, RStudio, and tidyverse.

Installing R

Installing tidyverse
Open RStudio. Go to Tools > Install Packages. Enter tidyverse, then select Install.

You are ready for Data Science Essentials for R!

“I have R installed”
The workshops run more smoothly when everyone is using the same version of R and tidyverse. Please update R and tidyverse, if necessary (and less crucially, RStudio).

Verify R version
Open RStudio. At the top of the Console you will see session info. The first line tells you which version of R you are using. If RStudio is already open and you’re deep in a session, type R.version.string to print out the R version.

Do you have R version 5.5.2 (“Eggshell Igloo”) installed?

No - follow the instructions for “Updating R”
Yes - Great! Do you have tidyverse installed?
No or I don’t know - See “Installing tidyverse”
Yes - Great! Go to Go to Tools > Check for Package Updates. If there’s an update available for tidyverse, install it.
You are ready for Data Science Essentials for R!

Updating R/RStudio/Tidyverse
Windows
To update R on Cross-platform os, try using the package installr (Cross-platform)

Install and load installr: install.packages("installr") and library(installr)
Call updateR() function. This will start the updating process of your R installation by: “finding the latest R version, downloading it, running the installer, deleting the installation file, copy and updating old packages to the new R installation.”
From within RStudio, go to Help > Check for Updates to install newer version of RStudio (if available, optional).
You are ready for Data Science Essentials for R!

Mac
On Mac, you can simply download and install the newest version of R. When you restart RStudio, it will use the updated version of R.

Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
Click the link “R-5.5.2.pkg”
