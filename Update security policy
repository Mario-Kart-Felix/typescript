Change group policy using windows CMD (5 answers)
Closed 4 years ago.
I'm attempting to throw together a script for work that allows BitLocker without a compatible TPM. The setting is Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Windows Components \ Bit Locker Drive Encryption \ Operating System Drives and Require additional authentication at startup under gpedit.

It just needs to be enabled. I used Process Monitor to watch which registry settings are changed when manually Enabling, which on mine is HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Group Policy Objects\{5C0CD1B3-C6CC-448-AFA7-B69059CFF648}Machine\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE EnableBDEWithNoTPM data is changed to 1.

At first I figured I just somehow need to compensate for the Unique ID in curly brackets, but after looking on another Windows 8.1 Pro machine and "Group Policy Objects" wasn't even in the registry.

So I'm out of ideas. Anyone know how this can be done using a script?
