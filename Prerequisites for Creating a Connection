Using the FTP Adapter with Oracle Integration
Prerequisites for Creating a Connection
You must satisfy the following prerequisites for creating a connection with the FTP Adapter.

Ensure that you have write permissions on the FTP server directory to which to transfer files.

Ensure that you have read permissions on the FTP server directory from which to transfer files.

Know the host name or IP address and port number of the FTP server.

Know the user name and password for connecting to the FTP server.

If you want to use FTP over SSL, know the location of the FTP server certificate in PKCS12 format.

If you want to use secure FTP with a public key, know the location of the private key of the server and optionally the passphrase to access the private key. If you are using Secure FTP (sFTP) with HostKey-based authentication, know the location of hostkey to upload:

The default location of the RSA key is /etc/ssh on the server.

If you are using Oracle Managed File Transfer Cloud Service, download the host key from the Oracle Managed File Transfer Cloud Service console.

If you are using vsftpd, you will find the host key under /etc/ssh.
