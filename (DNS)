The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the fundamental protocols of the Internet. It provides a lookup service that converts domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.0.0).

While DNS has always been an important protocol, the growing use of cloud-based services has made it even more so. IP addresses of services (such as Microsoft 365 servers) change regularly, and the DNS system is necessary to ensure that users of these services are connecting to the correct device.

A prime example of the importance of availability and security of the DNS infrastructure is the 2016 Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack against Dyn, a widely-used DNS provider. During the attack against a single companyâ€™s servers, a significant number of major websites became inaccessible to a large number of users in Europe and North America.
