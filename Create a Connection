Integration
Using the FTP Adapter with Oracle Integration
Create a Connection
Before you can build an integration, you have to create the connections to the applications with which you want to share data.

To create a connection in Oracle Integration:

In the left navigation pane, click Home > Integrations > Connections.

Click Create.

Note:You can also create a connection in the integration canvas of:
An orchestrated integration (See Define Inbound Triggers and Outbound Invokes.)

A basic routing integration (See Add a Trigger (Source) Connection.)

In the Create Connection — Select Adapter dialog, select the adapter to use for this connection. To find the adapter, scroll through the list, or enter a partial or full name in the Search field and click Search iconSearch.

In the Create Connection dialog, enter the information that describes this connection.

Enter a meaningful name to help others find your connection when they begin to create their own integrations. The name you enter is automatically added in capital letters to the Identifier field. If you modify the identifier name, don't include blank spaces (for example, SALES OPPORTUNITY).
Enter optional keywords (tags). You can search on the connection keywords on the Connections page.
Select the role (direction) in which to use this connection (trigger, invoke, or both). Only the roles supported by the adapter are displayed for selection. When you select a role, only the connection properties and security policies appropriate to that role are displayed on the Connections page. If you select an adapter that supports both invoke and trigger, but select only one of those roles, you'll get an error when you try to drag the adapter into the section you didn't select. For example, let's say you configure a connection for the Oracle Service Cloud (RightNow) Adapter as only an invoke. Dragging the adapter to a trigger section in the integration produces an error.
Enter an optional description of the connection.
Click Create.

Your connection is created. You're now ready to configure the connection details, such as connection properties, security policies, connection login credentials, and (for certain connections) agent group.

Configure Connection Properties
The FTP Adapter supports the following types of FTP connections.

FTP connection: The FTP Adapter supports passive communication to an FTP server. You must configure passive configurations in the FTP server.
FTP over SSL connection: The FTP Adapter supports FTP over SSL, which supports explicit FTP over SSL.
sFTP connection: The FTP Adapter supports communication with a secure FTP server.
Note:File Server only supports sFTP connections.
Configure an FTP Connection
Enter FTP connection information so your application can process requests.

Go to the Connection Properties section.
Enter the following details:
Element	Description
FTP Server Host Address	Enter the host address of the FTP/FTPS server.
FTP Server Port	Enter the FTP server port number.
SFTP Connection	Select No from the list.
Passive IP as Host Address	If using a different IP in a passive configuration, select Yes from the list.
FTP Server OS	Select either Unix or Windows as the operating system of the host on which the FTP server is installed. The list operation requires this information to parse the response because Unix and Microsoft Windows use different line-ending characters.
Note: This is an optional field used only with the List Files operation on the Invoke Operations page. See Invoke Operations Page.

FTP Server Time Zone	Select the time zone of the FTP server.
Note: This is an optional field. If you plan to specify a processing delay, use the Minimum Age field of the List Files operation on the Invoke Operations page.

Configure an FTP over SSL Connection
Enter FTP over SSL connection information so your application can process requests.

Go to the Connection Properties section.
Enter the following details:
Element	Description
FTP Server Host Address	Enter the host address of the FTP/FTPS/sFTP server.
FTP Server Port	Enter the FTP server port number.
SFTP Connection	Select No from the list.
Passive IP as Host Address	If using a different IP in a passive configuration, select Yes from the list.
FTP SSL Type	
Explicit
Implicit
SSL Certificate	Note: This field is now optional. The PKCS12 certificate format is no longer required. You can instead upload a public certificate on the Certificates page. See Upload an SSL Certificate in Using Integrations in Oracle Integration.
If you are using an FTP over SSL certificate, click Upload icon to upload a certificate in PKCS12 format (.p12 extension).

FTP Server OS	Select either Unix or Windows as the operating system of the host on which the FTP server is installed. The list operation requires this information to parse the response because Unix and Microsoft Windows use different line-ending characters.
Note: This is an optional field used only with the List Files operation on the Invoke Operations page. See Invoke Operations Page.

Channel Mask	If you are using FTP over SSL, select a channel encryption option:
Control: Encrypts the control channel. Data is transferred in plain text.
Data: Encrypts the data transferred. Commands in the control channel are in plain text.
Both: Encrypts both the control and data channels.
None: No encryption is performed.
FTP Server Time Zone	Select the time zone of the FTP server.
Configure an sFTP Connection
Enter sFTP connection information so your application can process requests.

Note:File Server only supports this type of connection.
Go to the Connection Properties section.
Enter the following details:
Element	Description
FTP Server Host Address	Enter the host address of the FTP/FTPS/sFTP server.
FTP Server Port	Enter the FTP server port number.
SFTP Connection	Select Yes from the list.
Host Key	This is an optional field for adding extra security for host key authentication. Host key authentication is used by a server to verify its identity to a client (the FTP Adapter, in this case). This authentication guards against “man-in-the-middle” style attacks.
Click the Host Key checkbox.
Note: If you are using Oracle Managed File Transfer Cloud Service, see Post-Provisioning Tasks in Using Oracle Managed File Transfer Cloud Service for information about gathering this information on MFT embedded servers.

Click Upload to upload the host key.
The default location of the RSA key is /etc/ssh on the server.

If you are using Oracle Managed File Transfer Cloud Service, download the host key from the Oracle Managed File Transfer Cloud Service console.

If you are using vsftpd, you can find the host key under /etc/ssh.

See Generate SSH Keys in PEM Format to Connect to a Public or On-Premises sFTP Server.

SFTP Key Exchange Algorithm	This selection is required if you are using an sFTP connection. If your sFTP server is restricted to a specific algorithm, select an algorithm to use from the list.
Note: If you use the FTP Adapter with the connectivity agent, you must select a value for this field. Do not select the algorithm diffie-hellman-group1-sha1. This algorithm is not supported with the connectivity agent.

Configure Connection Security
Security policies capture information about how the FTP Adapter must authenticate against the target FTP server.

The following security policies are supported:

FTP Server Access Policy: This policy uses the user name and password for authentication and enables users to configure the PGP values.

FTP Public Key Authentication: This policy connects to the sFTP server using a key. This is used only for sFTP connections. The user enters a user name and uploads the private key file. A passphrase for the private key is optional. The user can also configure the PGP values in this connection.

FTP Multi Level Authentication: This policy uses multiple independent credentials to log in to the server. This process creates an extra layer of defense against unauthorized users. With this policy, you provide a user name, user password, private key, and private key passphrase to connect to the sFTP server. You also configure the first authentication sequence between the password and the public key.
Note:File Server does not support use of this security policy.
In addition, each security policy provides options for specifying PGP encryption and decryption and signing verification details.
Encryption
Provide encryption details if the FTP Adapter connection is used to encrypt the contents while writing the file to a target FTP server.
Do not provide encryption details if the file being written to the target FTP server is already encrypted using the stage file action.
Decryption
Provide decryption details if the FTP Adapter connection decrypts the contents while downloading the file from the source FTP server.
Do not provide decryption details if the stage file action is used to decrypt the downloaded file.
Signing and verification details:
Signing
Provide signing details if the FTP Adapter connection is used to write a file to the target FTP server that must be optionally signed.
Signature verification
Provide signature verification details if the FTP Adapter connection reads and downloads a file that is digitally signed from the source FTP server.
