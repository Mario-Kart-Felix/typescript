Hey everyone, just wanted to post some glitches I've been encountering during my playthroughs.

 

First of all, there is a room in Chapter 2 with an overturned table that says something like "Waits Betrayed Us". There is an area of the floor with some blood on it and there is a book and a clip board as well. If you move the clip board through the blood it will move underneath the blood texture.

Also in Chapter 2, after you use the Two-Man Console with Axel, and he is engaged in a struggle with a survivor, you are meant to go and club the survivor with your maintenance jack. I did this and they froze together, resulting in a blocked pathway.

 ðŸš€

I'll update as I go forward.

 

Feel free to add your own glitch log below. Cheers!
