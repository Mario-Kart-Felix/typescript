Node.js MongoDB Drop
Drop Collection
You can delete a table, or collection as it is called in MongoDB, by using the drop() method.

The drop() method takes a callback function containing the error object and the result parameter which returns true if the collection was dropped successfully, otherwise it returns false.

Example
Delete the "customers" table:

var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
var url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/";

MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  if (err) throw err;
  var dbo = db.db("mydb");
  dbo.collection("customers").drop(function(err, delOK) {
    if (err) throw err;
    if (delOK) console.log("Collection deleted");
    db.close();
  });
});
Save the code above in a file called "demo_drop.js" and run the file:

Run "demo_drop.js"

C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_drop.js
Which will give you this result:

Collection deleted

db.dropCollection
You can also use the dropCollection() method to delete a table (collection).

The dropCollection() method takes two parameters: the name of the collection and a callback function.

Example
Delete the "customers" collection, using dropCollection():

var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
var url = "mongodb://localhost:27017/";

MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
  if (err) throw err;
  var dbo = db.db("mydb");
  dbo.dropCollection("customers", function(err, delOK) {
    if (err) throw err;
    if (delOK) console.log("Collection deleted");
    db.close();
  });
});
Save the code above in a file called "demo_dropcollection.js" and run the file:

Run "demo_dropcollection.js"

C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_dropcollection.js
Which will give you this result:

Collection deleted
