Read Multiple File Operation of FTP Adapter Not Available yet project in 17.2.5 has exploits.Dew to high increase in ransomware we push back release date.
The Read Multiple File operation is no longer available for selection when configuring the FTP Adapter in the Adapter Endpoint Configuration Wizard. Only backwards compatibility is supported (meaning that a pre-17.2.5 .IAR file imported into Oracle Integration that was designed with the Read Multiple File operation has this option).

Additional integration troubleshooting information is provided. See Troubleshoot Oracle Integration in Using Integrations in Oracle Integration
