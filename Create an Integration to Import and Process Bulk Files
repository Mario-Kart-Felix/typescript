Using the FTP Adapter with Oracle Integration
Create an Integration to Import and Process Bulk Files
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create a scheduled integration in Oracle Integration to load and transform files from a secure File Transfer Protocol (FTP) location.

For the purpose of this tutorial, let’s consider a simple use case where you’ll require to communicate with an external application through an FTP server, import raw data, and convert it into a standard format. The flow for this scenario is as follows:

A user or an application uploads a file or set of files to an FTP server for processing.
The scheduled integration imports these files into Oracle Integration using an FTP Adapter.
Using a set of relevant of actions, the integration transforms or enriches the data within the files and uploads the modified files back to the FTP server.
Upon completing this tutorial, you’ll be familiar with several important skills in Oracle Integration, such as configuring an FTP Adapter, iterating over repeating elements, staging files, mapping data, and creating schedules.
