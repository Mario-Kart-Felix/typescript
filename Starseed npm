RunKit + 
Try any Node.js package in your browser
This is a playground to test code. It runs a full Node.js environment with all npm packages installed. Try it out:

starseed lists no main file and has no index.js, so it can't be directly required. If this is a mistake, please let us know. It may however contain internal files that you can require manually:


all documents on RunKit are public
require() any package directly from npm
use arrow functions, classes, template strings, and most of ES6
await any promise instead of using callbacks (example)
create your own embedded node.js snippets
This service is provided by RunKit and is not affiliated with npm, Inc or the package authors.
