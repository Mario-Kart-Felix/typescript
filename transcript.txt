Definition and Usage
The <script> tag is used to embed a client-side script (JavaScript).

The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.

Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.

Tips and Notes
Note: There are several ways an external script can be executed:

If async="async": The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing)
If async is not present and defer="defer": The script is executed when the page has finished parsing
If neither async or defer is present: The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues parsing the page
Tip: Also look at the <noscript> element for users that have disabled scripts in their browser, or have a browser that doesn't support client-side scripting.

Differences Between HTML and XHTML
In XHTML, the content inside scripts is declared as #PCDATA (instead of CDATA), which means that entities will be parsed.

This means that in XHTML, all special characters should be encoded, or all content should be wrapped inside a CDATA section:

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
var i = 10;
if (i < 5) {
  // some code
}
//]]>
</script>
Global Attributes
The <script> tag also supports the Global Attributes in HTML.
