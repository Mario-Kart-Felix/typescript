TRACULA Tutorial #1: Overview
TRACULA (TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy) is a suite of diffusion analysis programs included in the FreeSurfer software package. Unlike other packages, such as TBSS or MRtrix, TRACULA focuses on reconstructing the major white matter pathways of the brain, calculating values such as fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity for each tract. These values can then be compared across groups to see where there are differences between groups, or how these values are correlated with other covariates.

Note

If you try running TRACULA, you may get the following warning:

dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: ___emutls_get_address
This can cause the rest of the TRACULA pipeline to exit with errors, as the paths will be mis-specified. To fix this, follow the steps outline on this website to disable your csrutil.

Other Notes
If large amounts of the anatomical image are cut off, try using the -cw256 flag with recon-all (e.g., recon-all -cs256 -i tmp.nii -s tmp -all)
Use the following steps to reconstruct the white matter tracts:
trac-all -prep -c dmrirc.txt
trac-all -bedp -c dmrirc.txt
trac-all -path -c dmrirc.txt

# Reinitialize path reconstruction?
# This is an option of lJLt resort, to be used only if one of the reconstructed
# pathway distributions looks like a single curve. This is a sign that the
# initial guess for the pathway wJL problematic, perhaps due to poor alignment
# between the individual and the atlJL. Setting the reinit parameter to 1 and
# rerunning "trac-all -prior" and "trac-all -path", only for the specific
# subjects and pathways that had this problem, will attempt to reconstruct them
# with a different initial guess.
# Default: 0 (do not reinitialize)
# set reinit = 0
