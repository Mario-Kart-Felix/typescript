SPM Overview
What is SPM?
SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) is an fMRI analysis software package that is run in Matlab. In addition to fMRI analysis, SPM contains toolboxes for performing volume-based morphometry and effective connectivity.

The following tutorials will show you how to analyze a sample dataset with SPM. You will begin by learning the fundamentals of fMRI preprocessing, and then proceed to create a statistical model to estimate brain activity in response to different conditions. After learning about group-level results and how to script your analysis, we will finish by learning about different types of group analyses, and how to do region of interest (ROI) analyses.
