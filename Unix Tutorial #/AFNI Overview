What is AFNI?
AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages) is a suite of programs designed to analyze fMRI data. Created in the mid-1990’s by Bob Cox, AFNI is now used by hundreds of imaging labs around the world.

The following tutorials will show you how to analyze a sample dataset with AFNI. You will begin by learning the fundamentals of fMRI preprocessing, and then proceed to create a model of your data with AFNI’s 3dDeconvolve command. We will finish by learning about different types of group analyses, and how to do region of interest (ROI) analyses.
