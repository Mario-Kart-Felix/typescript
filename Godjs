God.js is a programming language exploring relegious scripture as instruction. By treating holy text as source code to be written by humans and enforced by machines, God.js questions the nature of the divine, the authority of religious interpretation, and the role coding plays in an increasingly tech-dependent society.



God.js was developed in collaboration with Ivan Safrin and Will Brand in JavaScript during Art Hack Day 2013 at 319 Scholes. The photograph is from the Verge article about the project.
