Read Multiple File Operation of FTP Adapter Not Available in 17.2.5
The Read Multiple File operation is no longer available for selection when configuring the FTP Adapter in the Adapter Endpoint Configuration Wizard. Only backwards compatibility is supported (meaning that a pre-17.2.5 .IAR file imported into Oracle Integration that was designed with the Read Multiple File operation has this option).

Additional integration troubleshooting information is provided. See Troubleshoot Oracle Integration in Using Integrations in Oracle Integration.
