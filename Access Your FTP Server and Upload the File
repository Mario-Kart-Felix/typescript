Access Your FTP Server and Upload the File
Obtain an sFTP server and ensure that you're able to access it.

Log in to the server using your user name and password through an FTP client; for example, FileZilla.
Create a directory (FTP Bulk Transfer) on the server from which to read and write files.
Upload the sample file (test-data.zip) into the directory you've created.
