Using the FTP Adapter with Oracle Integration
Generate SSH Keys in PEM Format to Connect to a Public or On-Premises sFTP Server
You receive the following error when testing your connection after using an upgraded ssh-keygen tool to generate SSH keys in OPENSSH format. OPENSSH is a proprietary format. Oracle Integration requires the keys to be in PEM format.

CASDK-0004: Failed to authenticate against the application with the
credentials provided; Private Key or Passphrase is incorrect. Please verify
the Private Key and Passphrase.
Verify the key by opening the file in Notepad. The key must start with the following phrase. Oracle Integration supports keys in this format:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
The following format is not supported. You must regenerate your keys in PEM format.

-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
Use -m PEM with ssh-keygen to generate private keys in PEM format:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -m PEM
