Using the FTP Adapter with Oracle Integration
Common Message Exchange Patterns
You can use the FTP Adapter in a variety of message exchange patterns, including the following:

Triggered by the SOAP Adapter, the REST Adapter, or a schedule in an integration.

Polling an FTP directory:

Create a scheduled orchestrated integration. Do not create a Map Data integration.

Configure the FTP Adapter with the List File operation.

Create a for-each action.

Configure the FTP Adapter with the Read File Operation inside the for-each action to read a file.

Map the file name and directory header from the for-each action loop.

Downloading a file from an embedded SFTP server with Oracle Managed File Transfer / Oracle Managed File Transfer Cloud Service:

A file is placed in an embedded SFTP server.

Oracle Managed File Transfer sends a multipart SOAP notification to Oracle Integration.

Oracle Integration receives the SOAP message and extracts the file name.

The FTP Adapter is invoked and sets the file name.

The file is downloaded to Oracle Integration.
