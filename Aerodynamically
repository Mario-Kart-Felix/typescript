Aerodynamically shaped, tethered balloons, commonly referred to as aerostats, provide high-endurance and cost-effective platforms for many airborne early warning applications. This chapter describes modern aerostats and support systems, their advantages and problems, and the radar sensors used on board.

var jsCloneDeep = require("js-clone-deep")
js-clone-deep
JavaScript utility method for deep cloning Object and Array.

How to use
Get the npm module from here

const clone = require('js-clone-deep');

// Source object
const source = {
  object: { nested: { deepNesting: { key: 1 } }  },
  array: [1 , 2, 4],
};

// Clone the object
const copy = clone(source);

console.log(source.object === copy.object);
// false

console.log(source.array === copy.array);
// false

Developer warning
This method currently supports deep cloning of Object ({}) and Array ([]) only. Data structures such Set, WeakSets, Maps, WeakMaps, Streams, etc will not be cloned.

Use this module considering the above limitation.
