show whitelist-db cpsec-seqshow whitelist-db cpsec-seqDescriptionDisplay the current sequence number for the master or local controller whitelists.SyntaxNo ParametersUsage GuidelinesThe current sequence number in theSequence Number Detailstable shows the number of changes to thecampus AP whitelist made on this controller.Each controller compares its campus AP whitelist against whitelists on other controllers every two minutes. If acontroller detects a difference, it will send its changes to the other controllers on the network. If all othercontrollers on the network have successfully received and acknowledged all whitelist changes made on thiscontroller, every entry in thesequence numbercolumn in the controller whitelist will have the same value asthe number displayed in theSequence Number Detailstable. If a controller in the master or local controllerwhitelist has a lower sequence number, that controller may still be waiting to complete its update, or its updateacknowledgement may not have yet been received.ExampleThe output of the first command below shows that the campus AP whitelist has been updated 3 times on themaster controller. The second command shows the local controller list on the master controller, and verifiesthat both local controllers have received and acknowledged all three of these changes.(host) #show whitelist-db cpsec-seqSequence Number Details-----------------------Table NameCurrent Seq Number----------------------------cpsec_whitelist3Whitelist Entries: 97(host) # show whitelist-db cpsec-local-listRegistered Local Controller Details-----------------------------------MAC-AddressIP-AddressSequence NumberRemote Sequence NumberNULL Update Count---------------------------------------------------------------------------00:0b:86:51:a5:4c 10.3.53.231000:A0:C9:14:C8:29 10.3.53.4300Whitelist Entries: 2Dell Networking W-Series ArubaOS 6.5.x|Reference Guideshow whitelist-db cpsec-seq |2040

An AP is put in this statewhen the controller thinks the AP a certified certificate yet the APrequests to be certified again. Since this is not a normal condition, theAP will not be reapproved as a secure AP until a network administratormanually changes the status of the AP to verify that it is notcompromised.Revoked entriesNumber of APs whose entries have been revokedMarked for deletion entriesNumber of APs whose entries have been marked for deletion.
