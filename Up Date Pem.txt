So if you have installed ca-certificates you can easily find out where the files are. Open a terminal and enter

> dpkg -L ca-certificates
/.
/etc
/etc/ssl
/etc/ssl/certs
/etc/ca-certificates
/etc/ca-certificates/update.d
/usr
/usr/sbin
/usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates
/usr/share
/usr/share/ca-certificates
/usr/share/ca-certificates/spi-inc.org
…
So you'll see that all certificates are in /usr/share/ca-certificates. However the default location for certificates is /etc/ssl/certs. You might find additional certificates there.

Probably this would help you:

apt-get install apt-file

apt-file update

apt-file list ca-certificates
